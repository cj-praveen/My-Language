### Developement Status

**Note**: This syntax is just for reference purposes.
```ruby
# Declaring a string variable;
string greet = "Hello!";

# Print the value of the variable greet;
print greet;

# Declaring a number variable;
number num = 1234567890;

# Print the value of the variable number;
print number;

# Print a message to the console;
print "Hello, World!";

# Exit the program;
exit;
```
